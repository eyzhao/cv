        Assessed the clinical actionability of a new class of cancer biomarkers
        related to genome instability. Developed mathematical models to infer
        changes in mutation signatures over time and applied these approaches
        to map the mutagenic landscape of metastatic cancers. Discovered signatures
        associated with chemotherapy sensitivity as well as signatures induced
        by chemotherapy.
