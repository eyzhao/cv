        $300,000. This grant funded my independent-conceived post-doctoral fellowship
        research under PI Dr. Trevor Pugh. Other co-investigators
        included Dr. Gelareh Zadeh, Dr. Federico Gaiti, and Dr. Stefan Pfister.
        The funded project spearheads the use of single cell methylation analysis
        to facilitate immune analysis in brain tumours. We propose to leverage
        immune inference for the analysis of large scale tumour methylation and
        to develop novel liquid biopsy biomarkers.
